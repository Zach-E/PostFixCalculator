 Post fix calculator using linked lists, useful for more precise numbers

This was a school project for Com Sci 228- Data Structures.
It implements an "amusing" linked list. The list is a siingly linked list, but every 5 nodes, the prev points to the last multiple of 5 node. The list is also circular.

There is then files that deal with adding and subtracting linked lists filled with ints, + sings, - signs, and decimal points.

This makes the code be able to add numbers that are beyond the bit limit for Java.

There is also a Deque implementation and a main method to use all the files.
